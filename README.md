# Known Issues

All the animations were built without the interacton of javascript,
as i am still on my journey of learning css

these are some part of the project that would need the interacton of javascript
for smoother animation transitions.

1. Section 1 (<section class="section1"></section>) with a div container of class marquee(<div class="marquee"></div>)

2. Section 6 (<section class="section6"></section>) with a div container of class section6-container(<div class="section6-container"></div>)
